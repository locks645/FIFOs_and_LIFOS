# FIFOs_and_LIFOs
A lab from my Digital Circuits course in which we created a queue (FIFO) and a stack (LIFO). Both modules are synchronous, parametric, and read-first, but the FIFO is circular whereas the LIFO is not. Both modules also come with an associated testbench to verify that they work: FIFO_tb and LIFO_tb.
