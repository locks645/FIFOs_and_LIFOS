# FIFOs_and_LIFOs
A lab from my Digital Circuits course which had me create a queue (FIFO) and stack (LIFO) module using Verilog. Both modules are parametric and read-first, but the FIFO is circular whereas the LIFO is not. Both modules also come with an associated testbench for verification purposes: FIFO_tb and LIFO_tb.
