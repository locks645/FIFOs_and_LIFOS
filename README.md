# FIFOs_and_LIFOs
One of the labs from my Digital Circuits course in which we created 2 types of stacks in Verilog: FIFO and LIFO. Both stacks are read-first, but the FIFO is a circular stack whereas the LIFO is not. Both modules also come with an associated testbench to verify that they work: FIFO_tb and LIFO_tb.
